[State â€” dpytest 0.7.0 documentation](https://dpytest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/state.html): LLM should read this page when working with discord.py testing, mocking ConnectionState objects, or implementing test functionality for Discord bots. (Documentation for the FakeState class in dpytest, which mocks the discord.py ConnectionState to support testing by allowing control over event dispatching and overriding methods that would cause issues in tests)
