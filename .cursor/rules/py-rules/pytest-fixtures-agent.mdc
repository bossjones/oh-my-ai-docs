description: "This rule governs pytest fixture management and organization. It should be applied whenever: (1) Creating new test files or fixtures, (2) Modifying existing fixtures, (3) Using fixtures in tests, or (4) Reviewing test code. This ensures consistent fixture management, prevents duplication, and maintains clear test organization."

# Pytest Fixture Management Standards

## Critical Rules

- ALWAYS define shared fixtures in the appropriate conftest.py:
  * Root `tests/conftest.py` for project-wide fixtures
  * Package-level `tests/package_name/conftest.py` for package-specific fixtures
  * Only create fixtures in test files if they are TRULY specific to that file

- NEVER duplicate fixtures across test files:
  * If you need a fixture that exists in another file, move it to conftest.py
  * If you find duplicate fixtures, consolidate them in conftest.py
  * Document fixture sources with comments when using shared fixtures

- ALWAYS specify fixture scope explicitly:
  * Use `scope="function"` for isolated test fixtures (default)
  * Use `scope="class"` for class-level shared resources
  * Use `scope="module"` for module-level shared resources
  * Use `scope="package"` for package-level shared resources
  * Use `scope="session"` for test session-wide resources

- ALWAYS provide comprehensive fixture documentation:
  * Describe the fixture's purpose
  * Document the scope and why it was chosen
  * List arguments and their types
  * Specify return/yield type
  * Document any side effects or cleanup

- ALWAYS organize fixtures by category in conftest.py:
  * Use clear section comments (e.g., "# --- Core Fixtures ---")
  * Group related fixtures together
  * Order from most general to most specific

- ALWAYS use type hints in fixture definitions:
  * Specify return types for synchronous fixtures
  * Use AsyncGenerator for async fixtures
  * Include None in generator return types
  * Use proper typing for fixture parameters

- ALWAYS clean up resources in fixtures:
  * Use yield fixtures for cleanup
  * Close connections and files
  * Reset mocked objects
  * Clean up temporary data

### Fixture Naming Conventions

- ALWAYS use descriptive prefixes to avoid collisions:
  - `fixture_` for general fixtures, e.g., `fixture_database_connection`
  - `mock_` for mock objects, e.g., `mock_api_response`
  - `test_` for test-related fixtures, e.g., `test_user_data`

- ALWAYS use namespacing with underscores for clarity:
  - `app_config_test`
  - `db_connection_test`
  - `api_client_test`

- ALWAYS use verb phrases for fixtures that perform actions:
  - `setup_database`
  - `create_test_user`
  - `initialize_environment`

- ALWAYS use domain-specific prefixes for clarity:
  - `discord_mock_client`
  - `ai_mock_response`
  - `env_mock_vars`

- ALWAYS indicate scope for temporary resources when helpful:
  - `temp_file_function` for function-scoped
  - `temp_db_module` for module-scoped
  - `temp_config_session` for session-scoped

## Examples

<example>
# Good - Proper fixture organization in conftest.py
```python
# --- Test Environment Configuration --- #

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def mock_env_vars() -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Provide base environment variables for testing.

    Scope: session - shared across all tests
    Returns: Dict of environment variables
    """
    return {
        "API_KEY": "test-key",
        "DEBUG": "true"
    }

# --- Core Test Fixtures --- #

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def settings(mock_env_vars: Dict[str, str]) -> Settings:
    """Provide test settings.

    Scope: function - ensures test isolation
    Args:
        mock_env_vars: Environment variables fixture
    Returns: Settings instance
    """
    return Settings(**mock_env_vars)

# Good - Using shared fixtures with documentation
def test_feature(settings: Settings, mocker: MockerFixture):
    """Test feature using shared fixtures.

    Note: Using standardized fixtures from conftest.py:
    - settings: Core settings fixture
    - mocker: PyTest mock fixture
    """
    result = process_with_settings(settings)
    assert result.is_valid
```

# Good - Async fixture with cleanup
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
async def client(settings: Settings) -> AsyncGenerator[Client, None]:
    """Provide test API client.

    Scope: function - ensures clean client for each test
    Args:
        settings: Test settings fixture
    Yields: Configured client instance
    Cleanup: Closes client connection
    """
    client = Client(settings)
    await client.connect()
    yield client
    await client.close()
```

# Good - Descriptive and Scoped Naming
```python
@pytest.fixture
def fixture_database_connection():
    # setup code
    pass

@pytest.fixture
def mock_api_response():
    # setup code
    pass

@pytest.fixture
def setup_database():
    # setup code
    pass
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Bad - Duplicate fixture definitions
```python
# test_feature1.py
@pytest.fixture
def settings():  # BAD: Duplicating settings fixture
    return Settings(debug=True)

# test_feature2.py
@pytest.fixture
def settings():  # BAD: Another duplicate
    return Settings(debug=True)
```

# Bad - Missing documentation and organization
```python
# conftest.py
@pytest.fixture  # BAD: Missing scope
def client():  # BAD: Missing type hints
    return Client()  # BAD: No cleanup

@pytest.fixture  # BAD: No docstring
def settings():
    return Settings()

# BAD: No organization or sections
@pytest.fixture
def database():
    return Database()
```

# Bad - Improper fixture usage
```python
# BAD: Creating module-level test objects
test_client = Client()

def test_feature():
    # BAD: Using global client instead of fixture
    result = test_client.process()
    assert result.is_valid

# BAD: Recreating fixture logic
def test_another_feature():
    settings = Settings(debug=True)  # Should use fixture
    client = Client(settings)  # Should use fixture
```

# Bad - Non-descriptive or Colliding Names
```python
@pytest.fixture
def db():  # BAD: Too generic, potential collision
    # setup code
    pass

@pytest.fixture
def response(): # BAD: Too generic
    # setup code
    pass

@pytest.fixture
def setup(): # BAD: Too generic, doesn't describe what is set up
    # setup code
    pass
```
