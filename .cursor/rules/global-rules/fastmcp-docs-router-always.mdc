# FastMCP Documentation Router

## Critical Rules

- For ANY question containing "FastMCP", "fastmcp", "MCP", or related concepts:
  1. ALWAYS call list_doc_sources tool first to retrieve llms.txt
  2. Call fetch_docs to read the llms.txt content
  3. Analyze and reflect on:
     - All URLs listed in llms.txt
     - The specific user question context and requirements
  4. Call fetch_docs again ONLY for URLs relevant to the user's question
  5. Synthesize information from fetched docs to provide accurate answers
  6. Include relevant code examples when appropriate
  7. Cite specific documentation sources used in the response
  8. Use the fastmcp-docs-mcp server configuration when available

- NEVER attempt to answer FastMCP questions without consulting the documentation
- ALWAYS provide source attribution for any technical claims about FastMCP
- If documentation seems insufficient, acknowledge limitations and suggest alternatives
- When using the fastmcp-docs-mcp server, ensure proper URL handling with the "fastmcp:" prefix

## Examples

<example>
User: "How do I implement a FastMCP server?"

Assistant's Process:
1. Called list_doc_sources -> retrieved llms.txt
2. Called fetch_docs -> read llms.txt content
3. Analyzed URLs and identified relevant ones about server implementation
4. Called fetch_docs on those specific URLs
5. Response: "Based on the FastMCP documentation at [source], here's how to implement a server..." üîß
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "Can you explain FastMCP protocols?"

Assistant's Process:
‚ùå Immediately answers without checking docs
‚ùå Makes assumptions about FastMCP functionality
‚ùå Provides generic information without sources
‚ùå "FastMCP protocols are probably similar to other protocols..."
</example>
