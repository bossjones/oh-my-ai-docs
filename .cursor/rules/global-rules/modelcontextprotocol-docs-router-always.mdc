# Model Context Protocol Documentation Router

## Critical Rules

- For ANY question about Model Context Protocol specifications or implementation details:
  1. ALWAYS call list_doc_sources tool first to retrieve llms.txt
  2. Call fetch_docs to read the llms.txt content
  3. Analyze and reflect on:
     - All URLs listed in llms.txt, particularly those with "modelcontextprotocol:" prefix
     - The specific user question context and requirements
     - Protocol version compatibility if mentioned
  4. Call fetch_docs again ONLY for URLs relevant to the user's question
  5. Synthesize information from fetched docs to provide accurate answers
  6. Include relevant protocol examples when appropriate
  7. Cite specific documentation sources used in the response
  8. Use the modelcontextprotocol-docs-mcp server configuration when available
