# cz-prepare-release.sh - Automates the release preparation process using Commitizen
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This script automates the process of preparing a new release by:
#   - Checking for uncommitted changes
#   - Determining the next version based on conventional commits
#   - Creating a release branch
#   - Bumping version numbers
#   - Running pre-commit hooks
#   - Creating a pull request
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - uv (Python package manager)
#   - commitizen (cz)
#   - pre-commit
#   - gh (GitHub CLI, optional but recommended for PR creation)
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/ci/cz-prepare-release.sh
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
#   PRERELEASE_PHASE - Optional. Set to 'alpha', 'beta', or 'rc' for prerelease versions
#   CI              - Optional. If set, indicates running in CI environment
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Standard release
#   ./scripts/ci/cz-prepare-release.sh
#
#   # Beta release
#   PRERELEASE_PHASE=beta ./scripts/ci/cz-prepare-release.sh
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0 - Success
#   1 - Various error conditions (see error messages)
