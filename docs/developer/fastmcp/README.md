I'll help break down the test file into separate documentation files based on the test groupings. I notice there are several distinct test classes that can be organized into separate documentation files.

Let me first create the documentation files for each test group:

I've broken down the test file into 5 separate documentation files:

1. [Basic server functionality tests including server creation, Unicode support, and decorator usage](./fastmcp_test_example_basic.md)
2. [Tool-related tests including basic operations, error handling, and content type handling](./fastmcp_test_example_tools.md)
3. [Resource-related tests including text/binary resources, file resources, and resource templates](./fastmcp_test_example_resources.md)
4. [Context-related tests including context injection, async support, logging, and resource access](./fastmcp_test_example_context.md)
5. [Prompt-related tests including registration, configuration, management, and execution](./fastmcp_test_example_prompts.md)

Each documentation file:
- Has a clear title and description
- Is organized into logical sections with descriptive headings
- Contains relevant test examples with explanatory comments
- Shows both successful and error cases where applicable
- Preserves all the original test code and assertions

The documentation is now better organized and easier to navigate, with each file focusing on a specific aspect of FastMCP's functionality. This makes it easier for developers to find and understand the tests they're interested in ðŸŽ¯

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the organization or add any additional information to any of the files? ðŸ¤”
