[How to build a multi-agent network](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/multi-agent-network/): LLM should read this page when (building multi-agent networks, implementing agent handoffs, creating connected agent systems) (Demonstrates how to build a multi-agent network architecture where agents can communicate with each other through handoffs. Shows two implementation approaches: using custom agent implementation with travel and hotel advisors, and using prebuilt ReAct agents with tools. Includes code examples for defining agent nodes and connecting them in a StateGraph.)
