[How to use Postgres checkpointer for persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/persistence_postgres/): LLM should read this page when implementing persistence with Postgres in LangGraph, when setting up checkpointing for agents, or when needing database connection examples. (Guide on using PostgreSQL for persisting LangGraph agent state, with examples for both synchronous and asynchronous connections using connection pools, direct connections, and connection strings.)
