[Durable Execution](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/durable_execution/): LLM should read this page when needing to implement pause-and-resume capabilities in workflows, handling long-running tasks with potential interruptions, or implementing human-in-the-loop processes. (Explains durable execution in LangGraph, which enables workflows to save progress and resume from the same point after interruptions. Covers requirements (persistence, thread identifiers, tasks), determinism considerations, using tasks in nodes to handle side effects, resuming workflows after pauses or failures, and identifying proper starting points for resumption.)
