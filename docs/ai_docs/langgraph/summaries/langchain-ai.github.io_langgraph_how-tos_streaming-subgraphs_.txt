[How to stream from subgraphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/streaming-subgraphs/): LLM should read this page when needing to implement streaming from subgraphs in LangGraph or when troubleshooting streaming issues with nested graph structures. (This page explains how to stream outputs from subgraphs in LangGraph by using the subgraphs=True parameter in the parent graph's .stream() method, including a complete example demonstrating how to access both parent graph and subgraph node updates with their respective namespaces.)
