[Time Travel ‚è±Ô∏è](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/): LLM should read this page when needing to understand time travel debugging in LangGraph, when troubleshooting agent decision paths, or when exploring alternative execution paths. (Time Travel in LangGraph includes two key techniques: Replaying, which allows revisiting past agent actions up to a specific checkpoint, and Forking, which enables exploring alternative execution paths from a previous checkpoint.)
