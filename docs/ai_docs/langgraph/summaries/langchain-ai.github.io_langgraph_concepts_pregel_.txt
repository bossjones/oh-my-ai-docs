[LangGraph's Runtime (Pregel)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/pregel/): LLM should read this page when needing to understand LangGraph's runtime architecture, implementing direct Pregel applications, or troubleshooting graph execution behavior. (LangGraph's Pregel runtime manages execution through actors and channels in a Bulk Synchronous Parallel model with three phases: Plan, Execution, and Update. It provides both basic channels (LastValue, Topic) and advanced channels (Context, BinaryOperatorAggregate) for communication between nodes, with examples of direct implementation and comparison to high-level APIs like StateGraph and Functional API.)
