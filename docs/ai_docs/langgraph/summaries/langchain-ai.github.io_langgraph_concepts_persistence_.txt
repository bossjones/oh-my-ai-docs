[Persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/): LLM should read this page when (implementing persistence in LangGraph applications; developing agents with memory; implementing human-in-the-loop systems) (This page explains LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves checkpoints of graph state during execution. Key topics include: threads (unique IDs for checkpoints), checkpoint management (get_state, get_state_history, replay, update_state), Memory Store for sharing information across threads, semantic search capabilities, checkpointer libraries, and how persistence enables human-in-the-loop workflows, memory between interactions, time travel for debugging, and fault tolerance.)
