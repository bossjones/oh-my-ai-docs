[How to use subgraphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/subgraph/): LLM should read this page when learning to use subgraphs in LangGraph, when needing to compose complex workflows, or when building nested state management systems. (This guide explains how to incorporate subgraphs in LangGraph applications through two methods: adding a compiled subgraph as a node when parent and subgraph share state keys, or creating a node function that transforms state between parent and subgraph when they have different schemas.)
