[How to connect a local agent to LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/local-studio/): LLM should read this page when setting up local agent visualization, connecting agents to Studio UI, or debugging LangGraph agents locally. (This page explains how to connect a local LangGraph agent to LangGraph Studio for visualization and debugging, including: setting up langgraph.json, installing langgraph-cli with inmem extras, running the development server with "langgraph dev", using the cloud-hosted Studio UI with locally running agents, and attaching optional debuggers.)
