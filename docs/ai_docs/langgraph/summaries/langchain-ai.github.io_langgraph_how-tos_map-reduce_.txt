[How to create map-reduce branches for parallel execution](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/map-reduce/): LLM should read this page when needing to create parallel processing workflows with map-reduce patterns or when implementing fan-out/fan-in operations for LLM tasks. (This page explains how to create map-reduce branching in LangGraph for parallel execution, using the Send API to distribute different states to multiple instances of a node and then combine results, with a complete example of generating jokes on multiple subjects and selecting the best one.)
