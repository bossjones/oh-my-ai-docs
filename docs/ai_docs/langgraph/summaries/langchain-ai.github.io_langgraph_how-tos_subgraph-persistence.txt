[How to add thread-level persistence to a subgraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/subgraph-persistence): LLM should read this page when implementing persistence in LangGraph applications with subgraphs, or when needing to debug state persistence across nested graphs. (This page explains how to add thread-level persistence to subgraphs in LangGraph by passing a checkpointer only to the parent graph during compilation, which automatically propagates to child subgraphs. It includes code examples showing setup, implementation, and verification of persistence for both parent and child graphs.)
