[Double Texting](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/double_texting/): LLM should read this page when needing to understand double texting options in LangGraph Platform, dealing with concurrent user inputs, or implementing messaging flow controls. (This page explains how LangGraph Platform handles "double texting" - when a user sends additional inputs before the first run completes - with four approaches: Reject, Enqueue, Interrupt, and Rollback. Each approach handles concurrent inputs differently with trade-offs in preserving state and user experience.)
