[How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/multi-agent-multi-turn-convo/): LLM should read this page when implementing multi-turn conversations in multi-agent systems or needing to add user interaction between agent handoffs. (This guide demonstrates how to create a multi-agent application that enables multi-turn conversations between users and agents using LangGraph. It covers creating a human node with interrupts to collect user input, routing between agents using Commands, and implementing handoffs between specialized agents while maintaining conversation continuity.)
