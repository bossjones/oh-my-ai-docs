[How to use LangGraph Platform to deploy CrewAI, AutoGen, and other frameworks](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/autogen-langgraph-platform/): LLM should read this page when needing to deploy third-party agent frameworks to LangGraph Platform, when integrating AutoGen or CrewAI with LangGraph, or when seeking deployment options for non-LangGraph agents. (This page explains how to deploy agents from frameworks like AutoGen and CrewAI using LangGraph Platform by wrapping them in a single LangGraph node, including setup steps, defining an AutoGen agent, wrapping it in LangGraph with proper schemas, and deployment instructions.)
