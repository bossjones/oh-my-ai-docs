[Assistants](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/assistants/): LLM should read this page when looking for information about LangGraph assistants, needing to configure agent parameters, or managing assistant versions. (This page explains Assistants in LangGraph Platform, which allow developers to configure and version agents without changing graph logic. It covers how to create, configure, and version assistants for different use cases while sharing the same graph structure but with different models and prompts.)
