[How to add runtime configuration to your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/configuration/): LLM should read this page when needing to add configuration options to LangGraph, when customizing graph behavior at runtime, or when implementing model selection in a graph. (This page demonstrates how to add runtime configuration to LangGraph workflows, including how to pass configuration parameters like model selection and system messages through the configurable dictionary in RunnableConfig, with complete code examples showing implementation patterns.)
