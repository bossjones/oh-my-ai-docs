[How to return state before hitting recursion limit](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/return-when-recursion-limit-hits/): LLM should read this page when needing to handle recursion limits in LangGraph, preventing graph execution errors, or returning final state data before hitting limits. (A guide showing how to modify a StateGraph to gracefully terminate execution before hitting recursion limits by using the RemainingSteps annotation, with examples of both problematic code that throws errors and the solution with proper state management.)
