[Memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/): LLM should read this page when needing to understand memory implementation in LangGraph agents, designing conversational agents that remember past interactions, or implementing long-term memory across conversations. (This page explains memory concepts in LangGraph, covering both short-term memory (thread-scoped, managed through state) and long-term memory (across threads, using stores). It details techniques for managing conversation history, different memory types (semantic, episodic, procedural), and approaches to writing memories (hot path vs. background).)
