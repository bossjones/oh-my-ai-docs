[How to add thread-level persistence to your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/persistence/): LLM should read this page when needing to implement state persistence in LangGraph, understanding thread-level memory for chatbots, or learning how to manage conversation history across interactions. (This page explains how to add thread-level persistence to LangGraph applications by using a checkpointer when compiling a graph, allowing conversations to maintain context across multiple interactions with the same thread_id, with code examples using MemorySaver.)
