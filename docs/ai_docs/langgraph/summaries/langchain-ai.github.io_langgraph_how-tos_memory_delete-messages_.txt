[How to delete messages](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/memory/delete-messages/): LLM should read this page when looking to delete messages from an agent's conversation history, when managing memory in LangGraph applications, or when implementing message pruning strategies. (This page explains how to delete messages from a graph's message state, both manually and programmatically. It covers using the RemoveMessage modifier, working with MessagesState's reducer, and demonstrates how to delete specific messages by ID or implement automatic deletion of older messages.)
