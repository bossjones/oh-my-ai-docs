[How to implement handoffs between agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/agent-handoffs/): LLM should read this page when (implementing agent handoffs in multi-agent systems) (creating tool-calling agents that can transfer control to other agents) (developing complex multi-agent networks) (The page explains two approaches to implement handoffs between agents in LangGraph: using Command objects for direct control flow and state updates, or using handoff tools that return Command objects for tool-calling agents. Both methods allow agents to pass control to other agents with optional payloads and state updates.)
