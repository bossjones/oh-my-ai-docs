[Standalone Container](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_standalone_container/): LLM should read this page when needing information about the Standalone Container deployment option for LangGraph, when comparing different LangGraph deployment architectures, or when planning to self-host LangGraph infrastructure. (The page describes the Standalone Container deployment option for LangGraph Server, which is the least restrictive deployment model where users manage their own data plane infrastructure without a control plane. It includes architecture diagrams and supports deployment on Kubernetes or any Docker-supported compute platform.)
