[How to wait for user input using interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input/): LLM should read this page when (wanting to implement user input capabilities in LangGraph flows) (learning how to pause and resume graph execution to wait for human feedback) (This page demonstrates how to use the interrupt() function in LangGraph to pause graph execution, collect user input, and then continue execution with that input. It includes examples of simple usage patterns, implementation in an agent context, and shows how to use Command(resume=...) to provide user responses.)
