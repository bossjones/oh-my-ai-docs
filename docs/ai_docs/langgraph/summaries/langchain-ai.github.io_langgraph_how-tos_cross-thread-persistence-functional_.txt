[How to add cross-thread persistence (functional API)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/cross-thread-persistence-functional/): LLM should read this page when implementing cross-thread persistence in LangGraph with functional API, or when using shared memory across different conversation threads. (Tutorial on implementing cross-thread persistence with LangGraph's functional API using Store interface, including setup with InMemoryStore, creating embeddings for memory search, and building a workflow that stores and retrieves user information across different conversation threads)
