[LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_cli/): LLM should read this page when needing to use LangGraph CLI tools, deploying LangGraph servers locally, or building Docker images for LangGraph applications. (The LangGraph CLI is a command-line tool for managing LangGraph API servers with four main commands: 'build' for creating Docker images, 'dev' for lightweight development servers with hot reloading, 'up' for running local Docker instances, and 'dockerfile' for generating custom Dockerfiles.)
