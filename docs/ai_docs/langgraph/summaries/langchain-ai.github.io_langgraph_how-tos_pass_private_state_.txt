[How to pass private state between nodes](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/pass_private_state/): LLM should read this page when needing to pass data selectively between graph nodes, when implementing private state in LangGraph, or when designing complex node communication patterns. (This page demonstrates how to share private information between specific nodes in a LangGraph without including it in the main graph state, using TypedDict classes to define different schemas for node inputs/outputs and controlling what data is accessible to each node in the execution flow.)
