[Self-Hosted Control Plane (Beta)](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_self_hosted_control_plane/): LLM should read this page when needing information about self-hosted LangGraph control plane deployment, understanding deployment architecture options, or exploring Kubernetes-based LangGraph hosting. (This page describes the Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option for LangGraph, where users manage both control plane and data plane in their own cloud environment. It covers the architecture, responsibilities, and specifically mentions Kubernetes as a supported compute platform.)
