[Streaming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/): LLM should read this page when needing to implement streaming capabilities in LangGraph applications, understanding different streaming modes, or building responsive LLM applications. (This page explains streaming in LangGraph, covering methods like .stream and .astream with their various modes (values, updates, custom, messages, debug), how to combine multiple streaming modes, and how streaming works in the LangGraph Platform for creating responsive applications with real-time updates.)
