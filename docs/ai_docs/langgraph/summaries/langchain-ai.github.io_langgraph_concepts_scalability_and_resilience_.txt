[LangGraph Platform: Scalability & Resilience](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/scalability_and_resilience/): LLM should read this page when needing to understand LangGraph Platform's scalability capabilities, when evaluating deployment architecture for high-availability applications, or when troubleshooting resilience mechanisms. (Explains how LangGraph Platform achieves horizontal scalability through stateless server design, queue scalability with concurrent runs, and system resilience through heartbeat mechanisms, Postgres database backups, and Redis for ephemeral metadata storage. Details how the platform handles failure scenarios and maintains high availability.)
