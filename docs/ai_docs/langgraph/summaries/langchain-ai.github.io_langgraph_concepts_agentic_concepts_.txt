[Agent architectures](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/): LLM should read this page when working with agent implementation patterns, designing custom agent architectures, or understanding different types of LLM control flow. (This page covers LangGraph agent architectures, explaining routers with structured outputs, tool-calling agents implementing ReAct pattern (tool calling, memory, planning), and custom architectures including human-in-the-loop, parallelization, subgraphs, and reflection mechanisms.)
