[Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/v0-human-in-the-loop/): LLM should read this page when needing to implement human-in-the-loop patterns with LangGraph, understanding interaction patterns for agent workflows, or learning about interrupting agent execution for human input. (This page explains human-in-the-loop capabilities in LangGraph, covering persistence, breakpoints, interaction patterns (approval, editing, input), and use cases like reviewing tool calls and time travel (replaying/forking).)
