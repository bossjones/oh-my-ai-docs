[Self-Hosted](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/self_hosted/): LLM should read this page when looking for self-hosted LangGraph deployment options, understanding LangGraph's enterprise vs lite versions, or researching requirements for self-hosted deployment. (The page explains the two versions of self-hosted LangGraph deployments: Self-Hosted Lite (limited to 1M nodes/year) and Self-Hosted Enterprise (requires license key). It covers deployment requirements, how self-hosting works with Redis and Postgres, and provides information about available Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.)
