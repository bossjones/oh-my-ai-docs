[How to add dynamic breakpoints with NodeInterrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/dynamic_breakpoints/): LLM should read this page when needing to implement dynamic breakpoints in LangGraph workflows, when adding conditional human intervention points, or when troubleshooting graph interruptions. (Guide on implementing NodeInterrupt in LangGraph for dynamic breakpoints, including how to define interrupt conditions within nodes, how to handle interrupted states, and how to update graph state to resume execution after an interruption.)
