[How to view and update state in subgraphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/subgraphs-manage-state/): LLM should read this page when learning how to access and modify state within subgraphs, handling breakpoints in nested graph flows, or implementing human-in-the-loop patterns. (Guide shows how to view and update state in subgraphs using persistence, including resuming execution from breakpoints, modifying state before execution continues, acting as a specific node in a subgraph, and handling these operations in multilevel nested subgraphs.)
