[Breakpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/breakpoints/): LLM should read this page when needing to implement debugging pauses in LangGraph workflows, understanding how to create human-in-the-loop systems, or troubleshooting graph execution. (Explains breakpoints in LangGraph which pause execution at specific points to enable debugging or human intervention. Covers static breakpoints that trigger before/after nodes, NodeInterrupt exceptions for conditional pausing, and requirements for implementation including checkpointers and thread IDs.)
